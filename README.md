# Firebase

In this Application I've used Firebase Libraries to perform User Authentication and added RealTime Database.

# Firebase Authentication

I've used Email/Password as a Sign-in method.
Which will not only Authenticate the existing users but also register the new users, if they haven't joinned already.

# Firebase RealTime Database

Application will automatically refresh if there are any sort of changes made on the RealTime Database.
Even if a row has been deleted from the database, the application will reload the adapter to update the current
data.

# Custom ArrayAdapter

I've Implemented a Custom ArrayAdapter along will custom Layout  which will give flexibility to the developer 
to ensure that what data is to show when the User is browsing.



However, I've also used Comments in order to describe the action of every function used in this Application.
